=== CRITICAL INSTRUCTION BLOCK (CIB-001)===

## MANDATORY TOOLS

### For Complex Tasks (research, analysis, debugging)
```
USE: mcp__mcp_docker__sequentialthinking
WHEN: Multi-step problems, research, complex reasoning
WHY: Prevents cognitive overload, ensures systematic approach
```

### For Task Management
```
USE: TodoWrite
WHEN: Any task with 3+ steps
WHY: Tracks progress, maintains focus
```

## MANDATORY EXECUTION PROTOCOL
1. Always complete all tasks fully. Do not simplify approaches, do not skip tasks.
2. Always keep tests up to date and maintain 100% test coverage.
3. Always test. 100% of tests must pass.
4. Always fix bugs. Never changes tests only to make them pass if the cause is in the code it is testing.
5. Never run Vitest in watch mode; automation must use `npm test`. Only set `ALLOW_VITEST_WATCH=1` when a human explicitly authorizes interactive debugging.

## FOLDER USAGE RULES

| Activity | Required Directory | Agent Enforcement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Browser automation (Playwright/Puppeteer runners, recorders) | `scripts/playwright/` | Keep every `.js`/`.mjs` harness here. Subfolders allowed, but **never** place these scripts in the repo root. |
| Physics, RNG, or analytics utilities | `scripts/tools/` | Import from `../../src` or `../../dist` as needed. No tooling lives in the project root. |
| Visual artifacts (screenshots, videos, GIFs) | `screenshots/` | Always persist captured assets here. Create nested folders like `screenshots/quality-test/` or `screenshots/videos/` to stay organized. |
| Documentation, research notes | `docs/` | Long-form analysis belongs in this directory instead of new markdown files at the root. |
| Temporary experiments / sandboxes | `src/dev-tools/` | Use this workspace for throwaway UI/physics spikes and clean it up after. |
| 🚫 Forbidden | Project root | Keep root pristine—no scripts, screenshots, or scratch docs. |
