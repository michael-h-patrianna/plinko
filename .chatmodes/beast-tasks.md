# Phase Plan

## Phase 1 – Understand & Plan
- [✓] Confirm execution order for checklist tasks (top-to-bottom with prerequisites).
- [✓] Capture assumptions/constraints for implementation wave in `.chatmodes/beast-knowledge.md`.

## Phase 2 – Implement Solution
- [ ] Execute checklist items sequentially, updating `docs/implementation-roadmap.md` statuses as tasks complete.
- [ ] Perform code/documentation updates required for each completed task.

## Phase 3 – Validate & Iterate
- [ ] After each task, validate against acceptance criteria and update logs.
- [ ] Decide whether to continue to next task or iterate on failures.
