# Phase Plan & Progress

## Phase 1 – Understand & Plan
- [✓] Re-ingest latest manual edits in provider/config/hook modules.
- [✓] Align roadmap milestones with current code state and outstanding gaps.
- [✓] Define concrete work items to close P0.1 prize provider acceptance criteria.

## Phase 2 – Implement Solution
- [✓] **Task A – Prize Provider Completion Checks**
	- [✓] Audit all prize usages to ensure they consume the provider session output.
	- [✓] Ensure `selectPrize` RNG is only used inside provider layer and document reasoning.
	- [✓] Backfill tests covering `createDefaultPrizeProvider` happy path and failure modes.
- [✓] **Task B – Documentation + Roadmap Sync**
	- [✓] Update `README.md` and `docs/architecture.md` with provider integration guidance.
	- [✓] Reflect progress in `docs/implementation-roadmap.md` P0.1 checklist.
	- [✓] Capture any new operational notes for integrators.

## Phase 3 – Validate & Iterate
- [✓] Run targeted Vitest suites and typecheck; expand to full run if clean.
- [✓] Validate outcomes against `.chatmodes/beast-prd.md` acceptance criteria.
- [⚠️] Determine if another iteration is required (<=3 total cycles).
