Phase Plan

Phase 1: Understand & Plan
- [✓] Task 1: Review README.md and gather context
- [✓] Task 2: Survey repository structure for performance-related assets
- [✓] Task 3: Define requirements and constraints from user brief

- Phase 2: Implement Solution
- [✓] Task 4: Perform thorough code review with performance focus
	- [✓] 4a. Analyze core physics generation (`src/game/trajectory.ts`, `rng.ts`)
	- [✓] 4b. Review React components for rendering performance (`App.tsx`, `Ball.tsx`, `PlinkoBoard`)
	- [✓] 4c. Inspect styles/build configuration (Tailwind, Vite) for bundle/perf impacts
- [✓] Task 5: Draft comprehensive performance review in docs/performance.md
	- [✓] 5a. Summarize current strengths
	- [✓] 5b. Detail performance risks & anti-patterns
	- [✓] 5c. Document recommendations & roadmap (incl. React Native)
- [✓] Task 6: Recommend improvements and next steps

Phase 3: Validate & Iterate
