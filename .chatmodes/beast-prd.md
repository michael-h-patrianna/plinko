# Problem Definition
- Provide a detailed, phase-aligned implementation plan covering priority levels P0 through P3 based on the current Plinko code review.

## Users / JTBD
- Maintainer reviewing the Plinko project who needs a concrete roadmap to implement recommended changes.

## Goals & Success Criteria
- Deliver a granular step-by-step plan for each priority tier (P0–P3).
- Ensure plan references relevant modules and sequencing.
- Keep plan actionable and ready for execution without further clarification.

## Scope
### In Scope
- Planning tasks derived from `docs/codereview.md` recommendations.
- Mapping steps to Phase 1–3 workflow artifacts.

### Out of Scope
- Writing or modifying application code.
- Running builds or tests.

## Functional Requirements
- Present implementation steps per priority tier in a checklist format that supports completion tracking.
- Highlight cross-cutting concerns (testing, documentation, cleanup) within the plan.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Clarity and completeness across priorities.
- Alignment with existing repo structure and tooling (Vite, React, TypeScript).

## Acceptance Criteria
- Checklist lists steps for P0, P1, P2, and P3 priorities with sufficient detail to execute.
- Each actionable item is represented as a checkbox (`[ ]`/`[x]`) to signal status.
- References include relevant files/modules for each step.
- Output validated against this document during Phase 3.
