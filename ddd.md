Flaws
Over-engineering / verbosity: Many components and hooks carry extensive boilerplate and comments. While thorough, it can make onboarding harder and may hide the “signal” inside verbose guard code. The team could rely more on convention and base components to cut noise.

Inline styles everywhere: Despite Tailwind/utility classes being available, critical layout logic is implemented with inline styles. Moving to styled primitives or CSS variables would centralize design tokens and simplify SSR/theming concerns.

Viewport & device detection: There’s custom logic for deviceInfoAdapter and dimensionsAdapter plus user-agent sniffing. Adopting browser APIs like matchMedia, ResizeObserver, and navigator.userAgentData (with fallbacks) would lower maintenance risk.

Testing gaps: The top-level integration test mostly checks render success. Given the depth of game logic, more direct unit tests of the state machine transitions, trajectory generation, and reset paths would raise confidence. Playwright likely covers it, but unit tests are easier to run and guard regressions sooner.
