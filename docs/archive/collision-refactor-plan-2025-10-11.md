# Collision Detection Refactor - Implementation Plan

**Date**: 2025-10-11
**Goal**: Eliminate false collision positives and achieve perfect visual/audio sync
**Strategy**: Validate CCD coverage → Remove visual feedback pass → Optimize thresholds
**Status**: Ready for implementation

---

## Prerequisites - Read Before Starting

### Understanding the Problem

1. **Current Issue**: The visual feedback pass (lines 183-202 in `collision.ts`) detects the same collision multiple times when cooldown expires
2. **Root Cause**: Ball lingers within 18px detection radius after bouncing, gets detected as "new" collision after 10 frames
3. **Solution**: Remove redundant visual feedback pass, rely solely on CCD (Continuous Collision Detection)
4. **Risk**: CCD might miss some collisions, so we validate first

### Files You'll Modify

- `src/game/trajectory/collision.ts` - Main collision detection logic
- `src/components/game/PlinkoBoard/components/OptimizedBallRenderer.tsx` - Rendering + effects
- `src/audio/hooks/useAudioPreloader.ts` - Sound configuration
- `src/tests/unit/game/` - Add new tests
- `src/tests/physics/` - Add validation tests

### Backup Strategy

Before making ANY changes:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/collision-refactor
git add .
git commit -m "Backup before collision refactor"
```

---

## Phase 1: Validation (DO NOT SKIP)

**Goal**: Prove that CCD catches all collisions before removing visual feedback pass

### Task 1.1: Create CCD Coverage Test

**File**: `src/tests/physics/ccd-coverage.test.ts`

**What to create**: A test that validates CCD detects all significant collisions

```typescript
/**
 * CCD Coverage Validation Test
 *
 * Purpose: Verify that CCD (Continuous Collision Detection) catches all collisions
 * that should trigger visual/audio feedback.
 *
 * This test runs BEFORE we remove the visual feedback pass to ensure CCD is sufficient.

    expect(coveragePercent).toBeGreaterThan(80);
  });
});
```

**How to run**:
```bash
npm test -- ccd-coverage.test.ts
```

**Expected outcome**:
- All tests pass ✅
- Console shows: "CCD Peg Coverage: 95%+"
- Zero missed collisions

**If tests fail**:
- ❌ **STOP** - Do not proceed to Phase 2
- Investigate CCD algorithm in `collision.ts` lines 57-98
- Fix CCD bugs before removing visual feedback pass
- Re-run tests until they pass

---

### Task 1.2: Visual Inspection Test

**What to do**: Watch 20 ball drops and manually verify collision timing

**Steps**:
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open browser to game
3. Drop ball 20 times from different positions
4. Watch carefully for:
   - Any peg that ball visually touches but doesn't flash ❌
   - Any peg that flashes but ball didn't touch ✅ (this is what we're fixing)
   - Timing between visual contact and flash (should be instant)

**Record observations**:
```
Drop 1: Left position - All collisions detected ✅
Drop 2: Center - Peg 5-3 flashed twice for single hit ❌ (expected, we'll fix this)
Drop 3: Right - All collisions detected ✅
...
Drop 20: ...
```

**Expected**:
- All visual collisions should have corresponding flashes
- You'll see duplicate flashes (that's the bug we're fixing)

**If any collision is NOT detected**:
- ❌ **STOP** - CCD has gaps
- Note which peg and position
- Investigate CCD coverage

---

### Task 1.3: Review Test Results

**Decision point**:

✅ **If both tests pass**: Proceed to Phase 2
❌ **If any test fails**:
  1. Document failures in `docs/ccd-investigation.md`
  2. Fix CCD algorithm in `collision.ts`
  3. Re-run Task 1.1 and 1.2
  4. Do NOT proceed until validation passes

---

## Phase 2: Remove Visual Feedback Pass

**Goal**: Eliminate duplicate collision detection by relying solely on CCD

**Prerequisites**: Phase 1 tests passed ✅

### Task 2.1: Backup Visual Feedback Pass

**What to do**: Comment out visual feedback pass so we can restore if needed

**File**: `src/game/trajectory/collision.ts`

**Find lines 181-202**:
```typescript
  // After physics collision, detect ALL pegs the ball is near for visual feedback
  // Apply same cooldown as physics to prevent duplicate detections across frames
  for (const peg of pegs) {
```

**Action**:
1. Find the entire loop from line 181 to line 202
2. Add a comment block ABOVE it:
```typescript
  // ============================================================
  // VISUAL FEEDBACK PASS - DISABLED 2025-10-11
  // Reason: Creates false positives when cooldown expires
  // See: docs/collision-review.md
  // If CCD coverage is insufficient, re-enable with direction check
  // ============================================================

  /* DISABLED - Uncomment if needed
```

3. At the end of the loop (line 202), add:
```typescript
  */ // END DISABLED VISUAL FEEDBACK PASS
```

**Verify**:
- Code still compiles ✅
- TypeScript has no errors ✅

---

### Task 2.2: Update Return Statement

**Still in**: `src/game/trajectory/collision.ts`

**Find line 204**:
```typescript
  return { x, y, vx, vy, hitPeg, pegsHit: pegsHitThisFrame };
```

**Change logic**:
Now that visual feedback pass is disabled, `pegsHitThisFrame` is only populated by the actual physics collision (line 169-170 in the code).

**Verify the physics collision adds to array**:

Find around line 168-171:
```typescript
    // Record collision
    hitPeg = peg;
    const pegKey = `${peg.row}-${peg.col}`;
    recentCollisions.set(pegKey, frame);
```

**Add right after line 170**:
```typescript
    // Record collision
    hitPeg = peg;
    const pegKey = `${peg.row}-${peg.col}`;
    recentCollisions.set(pegKey, frame);

    // Add to pegsHit for visual feedback (ONLY actual physics collision)
    pegsHitThisFrame.push({ row: peg.row, col: peg.col });
```

**Verify**: This line should already exist! If not, you need to add it.

**Check**:
- Line ~170 should have `pegsHitThisFrame.push(...)`
- Return statement still returns `pegsHitThisFrame`
- No TypeScript errors

---

### Task 2.3: Run Tests

**What to run**:
```bash
# Run all collision-related tests
npm test -- collision

# Run the CCD coverage test again
npm test -- ccd-coverage

# Run full test suite
npm test
```

**Expected**:
- All existing tests pass ✅
- CCD coverage test still passes ✅
- No new test failures

**If tests fail**:
- Read error messages carefully
- Check if `pegsHitThisFrame` is being populated correctly
- Verify you didn't accidentally break the physics collision logic

---

### Task 2.4: Manual Testing

**What to do**: Test in browser to see if duplicate flashes are gone

**Steps**:
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Drop ball 10 times
4. Watch for:
   - Peg flashes ✅ (should still happen)
   - Duplicate flashes ❌ (should be GONE)
   - Sounds playing multiple times for single hit ❌ (should be GONE)

**Record**:
```
Drop 1: No duplicate flashes ✅, all collisions detected ✅
Drop 2: No duplicate sounds ✅, timing feels snappy ✅
...
Drop 10: ...
```

**Red flags**:
- If you see a collision that doesn't trigger flash → CCD missed it → Go back to Phase 1
- If you still see duplicates → Visual feedback pass wasn't fully disabled → Check Task 2.1

---

## Phase 3: Optimize Thresholds

**Goal**: Fine-tune impact speed filtering to eliminate remaining noise

**Prerequisites**: Phase 2 complete ✅, no duplicate flashes observed ✅

### Task 3.1: Analyze Current Impact Speed Distribution

**What to do**: Add logging to see what impact speeds are being detected

**File**: `src/components/game/PlinkoBoard/components/OptimizedBallRenderer.tsx`

**Find line ~356** (in peg collision detection):
```typescript
            const impactSpeed = Math.sqrt(vx * vx + vy * vy);

            // Play sound ONCE for this collision if velocity is sufficient
            if (impactSpeed >= MIN_AUDIBLE_IMPACT_SPEED) {
```

**Add logging ABOVE the if statement**:
```typescript
            const impactSpeed = Math.sqrt(vx * vx + vy * vy);

            // TEMPORARY: Log impact speeds for threshold tuning
            if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
              console.log(`[Peg ${pegId}] Impact speed: ${impactSpeed.toFixed(1)} px/s`);
            }

            // Play sound ONCE for this collision if velocity is sufficient
            if (impactSpeed >= MIN_AUDIBLE_IMPACT_SPEED) {
```

**Do the same for walls** (around line ~397) and **slots** (around line ~525, ~542).

**Test**:
1. `npm run dev`
2. Open browser console
3. Drop ball once
4. Watch console output

**What you'll see**:
```
[Peg 2-1] Impact speed: 245.3 px/s
[Peg 3-2] Impact speed: 312.7 px/s
[Peg 4-1] Impact speed: 89.4 px/s    <- Low impact
[Peg 5-3] Impact speed: 412.9 px/s
...
```

**Analyze**:
- What's the minimum impact speed you observe? (typical: 50-80 px/s)
- What's the maximum? (typical: 400-600 px/s)
- Are there any very low speeds (< 50 px/s) that sound audible?

---

### Task 3.2: Determine Optimal Threshold

**Based on your analysis**, choose new threshold:

**Current**: `MIN_AUDIBLE_IMPACT_SPEED = 50 px/s`

**Recommendation**:
- If you saw impacts below 50 that were audible → Keep at 50
- If you saw impacts 50-75 that felt like noise → Raise to 75
- If you saw impacts 75-100 that felt like noise → Raise to 100

**Decision**:
```
New threshold: _____ px/s

Reasoning: ___________________________
```

---

### Task 3.3: Update Impact Speed Threshold

**File**: `src/components/game/PlinkoBoard/components/OptimizedBallRenderer.tsx`

**Find line ~331**:
```typescript
        const MIN_AUDIBLE_IMPACT_SPEED = 50; // px/s - micro-collisions below this are inaudible
```

**Update to your chosen value**:
```typescript
        const MIN_AUDIBLE_IMPACT_SPEED = 75; // px/s - raised from 50 to filter micro-collisions
```

**Do the same for**:
- Line ~372 (wall collisions)
- Line ~523 (slot wall collisions)
- Line ~540 (slot floor collisions)

**Find-and-replace** (careful, exact match):
```
Find: MIN_AUDIBLE_IMPACT_SPEED = 50
Replace: MIN_AUDIBLE_IMPACT_SPEED = 75
```

**Verify**: All 4 instances updated ✅

---

### Task 3.4: Update Sound Throttle Delay

**File**: `src/audio/hooks/useAudioPreloader.ts`

**Find line ~107**:
```typescript
      sfxController.setThrottleDelay('ball-peg-hit', 50); // Max once per 50ms
```

**Consider increasing** (only if still hearing rapid-fire sounds):

**Options**:
- Keep at 50ms if issues are resolved ✅ (recommended)
- Raise to 75ms if still hearing bunched sounds
- Raise to 100ms only as last resort (may silence legitimate collisions)

**Decision**:
```
Throttle delay: _____ ms

Reasoning: ___________________________
```

**If changing**:
```typescript
      sfxController.setThrottleDelay('ball-peg-hit', 75); // Raised from 50ms
```

---

### Task 3.5: Remove Debug Logging

**File**: `src/components/game/PlinkoBoard/components/OptimizedBallRenderer.tsx`

**Find all instances of**:
```typescript
            // TEMPORARY: Log impact speeds for threshold tuning
            if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
              console.log(`[Peg ${pegId}] Impact speed: ${impactSpeed.toFixed(1)} px/s`);
            }
```

**Delete these blocks** (you added them in Task 3.1)

**Verify**: No console.log statements in collision detection code ✅

---

### Task 3.6: Final Manual Testing

**Comprehensive test sequence**:

1. **Start fresh**: `npm run dev`
2. **Test 20 drops** from various positions:
   - 5 from left
   - 5 from center
   - 5 from right
   - 5 random positions

3. **For each drop, verify**:
   - ✅ Peg flash occurs when ball visually touches peg
   - ✅ Sound plays when peg flash occurs
   - ✅ No duplicate flashes for single collision
   - ✅ No duplicate sounds for single collision
   - ✅ Timing feels snappy and synchronized
   - ✅ No missed collisions (every visual contact triggers effect)

4. **Edge cases**:
   - Drop ball straight down center (high-speed, many collisions)
   - Drop ball at edge (wall bounces)
   - Watch ball settle in slot (slow bounces)

5. **Record results**:
```
Test 1: Left drop - All collisions detected ✅, no duplicates ✅, timing perfect ✅
Test 2: Center drop - 8 peg hits, all synced ✅
Test 3: Right drop - Wall bounce detected ✅, no duplicate sounds ✅
...
Test 20: ...

Edge case 1: Fast center drop - 12 collisions, all perfect ✅
Edge case 2: Slow settling - 3 floor bounces, all detected ✅
Edge case 3: Wall spam - Multiple wall hits, sounds spaced correctly ✅
```

**Success criteria**:
- 20/20 drops perfect ✅
- 3/3 edge cases perfect ✅
- Zero duplicate flashes observed ✅
- Zero duplicate sounds observed ✅
- Timing feels instant and snappy ✅

**If any issues remain**: Document in `docs/collision-issues.md` and investigate

---

## Phase 4: Update Tests and Documentation

**Goal**: Ensure tests reflect new behavior and document changes

### Task 4.1: Update Collision Cooldown Tests

**File**: `src/tests/unit/game/collision-cooldown.test.ts`

**What to update**: These tests check the visual feedback pass behavior, which we disabled

**Find**: The test descriptions mention "visual feedback"

**Decision point**:

**Option A - Update tests to match new behavior**:
```typescript
  it('should not report the same peg hit in consecutive frames within cooldown period', () => {
    // OLD COMMENT: Visual feedback pass sees lastHit=0 and frame=0...
    // NEW COMMENT: Only physics collision adds to pegsHit, cooldown prevents re-detection

    // Test expectations should remain the same
    // But comments should reflect that visual feedback pass is disabled
  });
```

**Option B - Add new test for CCD-only behavior**:
```typescript
  it('should only detect collisions via CCD, not distance checks', () => {
    // Test that pegsHit only contains entries from actual physics collisions
    // No entries from lingering within detection radius
  });
```

**Recommended**: Do Option A (update comments) + Option B (add new test)

**Action**:
1. Read through `collision-cooldown.test.ts`
2. Update comments that mention "visual feedback pass"
3. Add new test case for CCD-only behavior
4. Run tests: `npm test -- collision-cooldown`
5. All tests should pass ✅

---

### Task 4.2: Update Documentation

**Files to update**:

#### 4.2.1: `docs/COLLISION_TIMING_FIX.md`

**Add section at end**:
```markdown
## Update 2025-10-11: Visual Feedback Pass Removed

### Problem Identified
The visual feedback pass (lines 183-202 in collision.ts) was creating duplicate collision
entries when the 10-frame cooldown expired while the ball was still lingering near a peg.

### Solution Implemented
Removed visual feedback pass entirely. Collision detection now relies solely on CCD
(Continuous Collision Detection) via line-circle intersection math.

### Validation
- CCD coverage test added: `src/tests/physics/ccd-coverage.test.ts`
- 500 trajectory analysis confirmed CCD catches all significant collisions
- Manual testing: 20 drops with zero duplicate flashes observed

### Results
- ✅ Duplicate flashes eliminated
- ✅ Duplicate sounds eliminated
- ✅ All collisions still detected
- ✅ Timing remains snappy and synchronized
```

#### 4.2.2: `docs/collision-review.md`

**Add section at top**:
```markdown
## Implementation Status

**Date**: 2025-10-11
**Status**: ✅ Implemented - Visual feedback pass removed
**Result**: False positives eliminated, collision detection working correctly

See `docs/collision-refactor-plan.md` for implementation details.
```

#### 4.2.3: Create `docs/collision-refactor-results.md`

**New file** documenting the outcome:
```markdown
# Collision Refactor Results

**Date**: 2025-10-11
**Implemented by**: [Your name]
**Time taken**: [X hours]

## What Was Done

1. ✅ Validated CCD coverage via comprehensive testing
2. ✅ Removed visual feedback pass (collision.ts lines 183-202)
3. ✅ Optimized impact speed threshold to [X] px/s
4. ✅ [Optional] Adjusted sound throttle to [X]ms
5. ✅ Updated tests and documentation

## Before/After Comparison

### Before
- Duplicate peg flashes: ~15% of collisions
- Duplicate sounds: ~10% of collisions
- User reports: "sounds trigger multiple times for single hit"

### After
- Duplicate peg flashes: 0%
- Duplicate sounds: 0%
- User experience: Snappy, synchronized, realistic

## Test Results

### Automated Tests
- `ccd-coverage.test.ts`: ✅ PASS (0 missed collisions)
- `collision-cooldown.test.ts`: ✅ PASS (all 3 tests)
- Full test suite: ✅ PASS ([X] tests)

### Manual Testing
- 20 drops tested: ✅ All perfect
- Edge cases tested: ✅ All perfect
- No regressions observed: ✅ Confirmed

## Performance Impact

### Memory
- Before: ~6KB (recentCollisions + pegHitFrames + visual feedback tracking)
- After: ~5KB (removed visual feedback tracking)
- Savings: ~1KB

### CPU
- Before: ~100 distance checks per frame (visual feedback loop)
- After: ~50 distance checks per frame (CCD only)
- Savings: ~50% reduction in distance calculations

## Code Changes

### Files Modified
1. `src/game/trajectory/collision.ts` - Removed lines 183-202
2. `src/components/game/PlinkoBoard/components/OptimizedBallRenderer.tsx` - Updated threshold
3. `src/audio/hooks/useAudioPreloader.ts` - [If changed] Updated throttle
4. `src/tests/unit/game/collision-cooldown.test.ts` - Updated comments
5. `docs/COLLISION_TIMING_FIX.md` - Added update section
6. `docs/collision-review.md` - Added status section

### Lines Changed
- Lines removed: ~25
- Lines added: ~10
- Net change: -15 lines (simpler code!)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Redundancy creates bugs** - Having two collision detectors caused the false positive issue
2. **Validate before refactoring** - CCD coverage test was critical to ensure safe removal
3. **Physics belongs in physics layer** - Rendering should consume data, not detect collisions
4. **Simple is better** - Removing code solved the problem more effectively than adding more logic

## Future Considerations

### If Issues Arise
1. First check: Is CCD working correctly?
2. Second check: Are impact speed thresholds appropriate?
3. Last resort: Re-enable visual feedback pass WITH direction check (Solution C)

### Potential Enhancements
1. Store collision timing parameter (t) for sub-frame accuracy
2. Add velocity-based importance scoring for sound prioritization
3. Implement per-peg throttling instead of global throttling

## Conclusion

The refactor was successful. Collision detection is now:
- ✅ Simpler (one source of truth)
- ✅ More accurate (no false positives)
- ✅ More performant (fewer checks)
- ✅ Easier to maintain (less code)

The key insight: **Remove redundancy, don't patch symptoms**.
```

### Task 4.3: Update Code Comments

**File**: `src/game/trajectory/collision.ts`

**Update the file header comment** (lines 1-6):
```typescript
/**
 * Peg Collision Detection and Response
 *
 * Handles all collision detection and physics response for ball-peg interactions.
 * Uses continuous collision detection (CCD) via line-circle intersection to prevent
 * tunneling and ensure all collisions are caught.
 *
 * NOTE: Visual feedback pass was removed 2025-10-11 to eliminate false positives.
 * CCD is now the single source of truth for collision detection.
 */
```

**File**: `src/components/game/PlinkoBoard/components/OptimizedBallRenderer.tsx`

**Update comment at line ~324**:
```typescript
      // COLLISION DETECTION: Peg flashes (frame-drop-safe with look-ahead)
      // TIMING FIX: Trigger effects 1 frame early to synchronize with visual ball position
      // The trajectory stores POST-BOUNCE positions, but collisions happen earlier in the frame.
      // By looking ahead, we trigger effects when the ball VISUALLY appears to hit the peg.
      //
      // NOTE: Collision detection now uses CCD only (physics layer).
      // False positives eliminated by removing visual feedback pass (2025-10-11).
```

## Phase 5: Commit and Document

**Goal**: Create clean git history and preserve knowledge

### Task 5.1: Stage Changes

```bash
# Check what changed
git status

# Review changes carefully

### Task 5.2: Commit with Descriptive Message

```bash
git commit -m "refactor(collision): remove visual feedback pass to eliminate false positives

PROBLEM:
- Visual feedback pass detected same collision multiple times
- Ball lingering within 18px after bounce triggered false positives
- Caused duplicate flashes and sounds after 10-frame cooldown expired

SOLUTION:
- Removed visual feedback pass (collision.ts lines 183-202)
- Rely solely on CCD (Continuous Collision Detection)
- CCD validated via comprehensive coverage testing

CHANGES:
- collision.ts: Removed visual feedback loop
- OptimizedBallRenderer.tsx: Updated MIN_AUDIBLE_IMPACT_SPEED to 75px/s
- useAudioPreloader.ts: [If changed] Updated throttle delay
- Added ccd-coverage.test.ts for validation
- Updated documentation

RESULTS:
- Zero duplicate flashes ✅
- Zero duplicate sounds ✅
- All collisions still detected ✅
- Snappy, synchronized timing ✅
- Simpler, more maintainable code ✅

Testing: 20 manual drops + 500 automated trajectories
Coverage: CCD detects 98%+ of all pegs across test runs

See: docs/collision-refactor-results.md"

### Task 5.3: Create Pull Request (if using PR workflow)

**Title**: `refactor(collision): eliminate false positives by removing visual feedback pass`

**Description template**:
```markdown
## Summary
Removed redundant visual feedback pass in collision detection to eliminate duplicate
flash/sound effects caused by ball lingering near pegs after bouncing.

## Problem Statement
- Users reported sounds/flashes triggering multiple times for single collision
- Root cause: Visual feedback pass (lines 183-202) detected lingering as new collision
- False positives occurred when 10-frame cooldown expired while ball within 18px

## Solution
- Remove visual feedback pass entirely
- Rely solely on CCD (Continuous Collision Detection) via line-circle intersection
- CCD validated to catch all significant collisions (98%+ coverage)

## Changes
- ✅ Removed 25 lines of problematic code
- ✅ Added CCD coverage validation test
- ✅ Optimized impact speed threshold (50 → 75 px/s)
- ✅ Updated documentation

## Testing
### Automated
- `ccd-coverage.test.ts`: ✅ 0 missed collisions across 500 trajectories
- `collision-cooldown.test.ts`: ✅ All existing tests pass
- Full test suite: ✅ [X]/[X] tests passing

### Manual
- 20 drops from various positions: ✅ Perfect
- Edge cases (fast drops, wall spam, slow settling): ✅ Perfect
- Zero duplicate flashes observed: ✅
- Zero duplicate sounds observed: ✅

## Before/After Video
[Record side-by-side video showing old behavior with duplicates vs new behavior]

## Performance Impact
- Memory: -1KB (removed tracking structures)
- CPU: -50% distance checks per frame
- Code: -15 lines (simpler!)

## Rollback Plan
If issues arise:
1. Revert this commit
2. Re-enable visual feedback pass with direction check (Solution C)
3. See docs/collision-review.md for details

---

## Phase 6: Monitor and Validate (Post-Deployment)

**Goal**: Ensure fix works in production and no regressions

### Task 6.1: Collect User Feedback

**First 24 hours after deployment**:

1. **Monitor for reports**:
   - Check GitHub issues
   - Check support channels
   - Check analytics for error rates

2. **Specifically watch for**:
   - "Collision not detected" reports ❌
   - "Still hearing duplicate sounds" reports ❌
   - "Timing feels off" reports ❌

3. **Expected feedback**:
   - "Sounds are perfectly synced now!" ✅
   - "No more annoying duplicate sounds!" ✅
   - "Game feels more polished" ✅

---

### Task 6.2: Analytics Review

**If you have analytics**, check:

**Metrics to watch**:
- Error rate: Should not increase ✅
- Crash rate: Should not increase ✅
- Session duration: Should not decrease ✅
- User retention: Should not decrease ✅

**Positive indicators**:
- Increased session duration ✅ (more enjoyable)
- Higher retention ✅ (less annoying)
- Fewer support tickets ✅ (issue resolved)

---

### Task 6.3: Performance Monitoring

**Check system metrics**:

**Before fix**:
- Average FPS: [X]
- Frame drops: [X]%
- Memory usage: [X]MB

**After fix**:
- Average FPS: [X] (should be same or better)
- Frame drops: [X]% (should be same or better)
- Memory usage: [X]MB (should be slightly lower)

**Expected**: No performance regressions, possibly small improvement

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Problem: Tests fail in Phase 1 (CCD Coverage)

**Symptoms**: `ccd-coverage.test.ts` reports missed collisions

**Diagnosis**:
```typescript
// Check the test output
console.error('CCD MISSED COLLISIONS:');
console.error(JSON.stringify(missedCollisions, null, 2));

// Look for patterns:
// - Same peg missed repeatedly? → CCD bug for that peg geometry
// - Random pegs missed? → CCD parameter tuning needed
// - High velocity changes? → Collision happening between frames
```

**Solutions**:
1. **Check CCD math** (collision.ts lines 60-77):
   - Verify discriminant calculation
   - Check parameter t range [0, 1]
   - Ensure earliest intersection is used

2. **Check collision radius** (boardGeometry.ts):
   - Is `COLLISION_RADIUS` too small?
   - Should be `BALL_RADIUS + PEG_RADIUS` (~16px)

3. **Check frame rate** (simulation.ts):
   - Is `DT` appropriate for velocity?
   - Higher velocities need smaller timesteps

**DO NOT PROCEED** until CCD coverage is 100% (or 95%+ with documented edge cases)

---

### Problem: Manual testing shows missed collision

**Symptoms**: Ball visually touches peg but no flash occurs

**Diagnosis**:
1. Note exact position where collision was missed
2. Check console for errors
3. Reproduce with same drop position
4. Add debug logging:
   ```typescript
   console.log('CCD check:', {
     ballPos: {x, y},
     pegPos: {peg.x, peg.y},
     distance: Math.sqrt((x-peg.x)**2 + (y-peg.y)**2),
     collisionRadius: PHYSICS.COLLISION_RADIUS
   });
   ```

**Solutions**:
1. If distance < COLLISION_RADIUS but no CCD hit → CCD math bug
2. If happens at high speed → Frame timestep too large
3. If happens at specific peg → Check peg position data

**Recovery**:
- If isolated case: Document as known edge case
- If frequent: **STOP**, re-enable visual feedback pass with direction check

---

### Problem: Still seeing duplicate flashes/sounds

**Symptoms**: After Phase 2, duplicates still occur

**Diagnosis**:
1. Check if visual feedback pass is truly disabled:
   ```bash
   grep -n "for (const peg of pegs)" src/game/trajectory/collision.ts
   # Should be inside /* DISABLED ... */ comment
   ```

2. Check if there are multiple entries in trajectory:
   ```typescript
   // Add to OptimizedBallRenderer.tsx
   console.log('Peg collision frames:', pegHitFrames.get(pegId));
   // Should show: [100] NOT [100, 110]
   ```

3. Check if throttle is working:
   ```typescript
   // In SFXController.ts, add logging
   console.log('Throttle check:', { id, now, lastPlay, delay });
   ```

**Solutions**:
1. If visual feedback pass not disabled → Re-do Task 2.1
2. If multiple frames in trajectory → Something still adding to pegsHit → Investigate
3. If throttle not working → Check `setThrottleDelay` was called

---

### Problem: Impact speed threshold too high/low

**Symptoms**: Legitimate collisions not playing sound OR still hearing noise

**Diagnosis**:
- Check Task 3.1 logging output
- Analyze distribution of impact speeds
- Look for clustering

**Solution**:
- Adjust threshold iteratively:
  - Too many silenced: Lower threshold
  - Too much noise: Raise threshold
- Find the sweet spot (usually 75-100 px/s)

---

### Problem: Need to rollback

**Symptoms**: Critical issues in production, need to revert

**Immediate action**:
```bash
# Revert the commit
git revert <commit-hash>

# Push to production
git push origin main

# Deploy immediately
```

**Then**:
1. Document what went wrong in `docs/collision-rollback-notes.md`
2. Investigate root cause
3. Fix in development
4. Re-run full validation
5. Deploy again when ready

**Alternative - Re-enable visual feedback with direction check**:
```typescript
// In collision.ts, uncomment lines 183-202
// ADD direction check:
const isApproaching = dist < oldDist - 0.5;

if (lastHit === undefined ||
    lastHit === frame ||
    (frame - lastHit >= 10 && isApproaching)) {
  pegsHitThisFrame.push({ row: peg.row, col: peg.col });
}
```

This gives you the safety net back while fixing duplicates.

## Notes for Future Maintainers

### If you need to modify collision detection:

1. **Read these docs first**:
   - `docs/collision-review.md` - Understand the problem we solved
   - This file - Understand how we solved it

2. **Remember the lesson**:
   - One source of truth (CCD) is better than two (CCD + visual feedback)
   - Redundancy creates complexity and bugs

3. **Before adding new collision logic**:
   - Ask: "Can CCD be improved instead?"
   - If yes: Improve CCD
   - If no: Document why new logic is needed

4. **If you find a CCD gap**:
   - DON'T add a band-aid in rendering layer
   - DO fix CCD algorithm
   - Preserve single source of truth

### If false positives return:

1. First check: Did someone re-enable visual feedback pass?
2. Second check: Did CCD algorithm change?
3. Third check: Did cooldown duration change?

The solution is in the architecture, not in bandaids.
